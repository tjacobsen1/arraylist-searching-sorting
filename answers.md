Search questions

1. A normal search looks through every single item, while a binary search cuts the array in half until it finds the number, or unless there is only one left. 

2. Binary becaue it doesn't have to run as much and finds it faster. It doesn't search each individual item. 

3. 1. Normal search would go through each item and check if it is what it's looking for, and if it finds the item, it returns the index of it. In a binary search, it would cut the list in half, and go to the front half where the fruits start with B. But since it does not contain blueberry, it would never find it and keep cutting the list in half until it had only one item. 
   2. 11, and log11 times. 
   3. 1000, and log 1000 in binary.

Sorting questions

1. Selection sort is slow, insertion sort is faster, and bubble sort is the fastest.

2. 45 comparisons. 4950 for 100 items and 499500 for 100 items. 

3. The normal search would be better and would take less time, but if time isn't a factor then it's situational.
